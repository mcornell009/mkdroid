MkDroid
=======

MkDroid is a java application which will automatically generate an Android application out of any web app with a custom webview pointed at a copy of a website.

MkDroid has a Swing gui now! use it! (sorry)

The program takes three args (webroot src, android project destination, your website's domain name) or you can run it with no args and be prompted to enter the same for input. Using this will leave certain settings defaulted which you have control over in gui (which doesn't really matter).

Args are good because tab completion on file paths!
shout out to [Aurelien Ribon](https://github.com/AurelienRibon "Aurelien Ribon"), I stole a bunch of code from the libgdx-setup-ui project.
