mkdroid
=======

mkdroid is a java application which will automatically generate an android application out of any web app, simply by pointing it at the webfiles root folder.

The program takes three args (webroot src, android project destination, your website's domain name) or you can run it with no args and be prompted to enter input.
Args are good because tab completion on file paths!
shout out to [Aurelien Ribon](https://github.com/AurelienRibon "Aurelien Ribon"), I stole a bunch of code from the libgdx-setup-ui project.
